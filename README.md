# SCM to 3RD party marketplaces

## Introduction

I was a skins trader on CSGO from 2021 to 2023, until the release of CS2.  
I've been doing it on and off and managed to make some profit.  
But the release of CS2 as well as the fact that you could not use Buff163 without a Chinese bank account made me quit trading.  
As skins were still a hobby for me, I decided to just find investing opportunities and invest in skins instead of trading them.  
Here is my steam profile for those interested : [My Steam Profile](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199044961302)  

## What SCM to 3RD does

It serves one simple goal, make it easy to navigate from the Steam community market to 3rd party marketplaces such as Buff163, Pricempire, Skinport etc.  
When you are on an item page e.g. AK-47 | Asiimov (Field-Tested), you can see 3rd party marketplaces icons just bellow the item's image. (c.f. image1)

You can access the option pages by either clicking on the extension's icon on the top right of your Chrome, or by directly going on the options page by right clicking the icon then opening options.
